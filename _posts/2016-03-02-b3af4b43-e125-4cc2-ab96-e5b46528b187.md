So, you FINALLY got your activation email! Congrats! Welcome to the team. The links below will help you blast off into beta.

Before you start, you need to know a few things. This is very much a BETA. Things are going to be broken. Some features won't work like you would expect them to every time. You might not get a site that you're happy with... BUT, please know that we have some awesome improvements to the UI and site output coming.

Please take a few minutes to check out the links to get started.
