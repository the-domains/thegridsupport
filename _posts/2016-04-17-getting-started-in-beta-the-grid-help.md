So, you FINALLY got your activation email! Congrats! Welcome to the team. The links below will help you blast off into beta.

Before you start, you need to know a few things. This is very much a BETA. Things are going to be broken. Some features won't work like you would expect them to every time. You might not get a site that you're happy with... BUT, please know that we have some awesome improvements to the UI and site output coming.

Click the image to check out some videos that will get you a head start on creating the site you want.
