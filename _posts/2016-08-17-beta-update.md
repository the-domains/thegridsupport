**Hi There, Gridsters!**

**We've been hard at work pushing towards our launch and we're excited to announce a couple of changes to The Grid Beta!**

**Hi There, Gridsters!**

**We've been hard at work pushing towards our launch and we're excited to announce a couple of changes to The Grid Beta!**  
_**The New User Interface**_  
**Version 2 of The Grid Webapp is going live! Those of you on the original web app will be migrated to the new version within the week. If you're still using version 1, you'll see a banner giving you a countdown to this switch-over. The biggest thing to bear in mind is that for now version 2 only runs on Chrome, so make sure you download Chrome if you haven't already. We'll support other browsers in the coming weeks.**  
_**The New Site Design System**_  
**We've upgraded to our new site design system which we lovingly call DS-2 (It's short for Design System 2). This upgrade makes for more varied, polished and better looking sites, as well as allows for them to be created faster than they have been up to now.**  
**The Gridsites you currently have were built by the old engine (DS-1). We plan to launch DS-2 into beta testing within the next 48 hours and sunset the old one. If you see your sites updating on their own, don't be alarmed. This means your Gridsites are being redesigned and upgraded to DS-2\. After they are updated, they'll look even better than they do today! Be sure to check out your awesome looking "new" sites.**  
_**All Aboard!**_  
**All of our Founding Members will be invited to beta within the week. If you haven't been invited yet, don't fret... it's on the way!**  
**In the coming weeks and months we'll continue to improve the variability, aesthetics, and performance of all sites on The Grid. What kind of site will you make next?**  
**Love - The Grid**
